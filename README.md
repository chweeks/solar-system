# Solar-System

Building a model of the solar system with javascript and Jquery using Newtons laws of gravity. To view this simple app clone this repo to your device `git clone https://github.com/chweeks/solar-system.git`, navitgate to the repo `cd solar-system` and `open index.html` to run. 

In it's current state you may simulate one earth year and depnding on screen size may see all 9 planets orbit around the sun. In the future I would like to upgrade to elliptical orbits and to display each planets position on request from the user which is at the moment being calculated but not displayed.
